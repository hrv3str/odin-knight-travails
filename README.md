# Odin Knight Travails

## Introduction

Odin Knight Travails is a web application that visualizes a problem involving finding the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard, using the breadth-first search algorithm. This project is a solution for a lesson on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails). It allows users to interact with a chessboard, place a knight figure as a starting point, mark a target cell, and then run the algorithm to find and visualize the shortest path.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Webpack
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## Usage

You can drag and drop the knight and target figures onto the chessboard to mark the starting and target cells. Click the "Begin Travails!" button to start the algorithm and visualize the path.

## Features

- Interactive chessboard interface.
- Ability to place a knight figure and a target mark on the board.
